<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am now a third year Ph.D. student supervised by Prof. Jiafeng Guo, in Computer Science at Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My general research interests lie in the field of information retrieval and natural language processing. Now, My mainly focuses on generative information retrieval.

# 📝 Industry applications
[2023] **Official site retrieval at Baidu search engine**  
Official site retrieval task aims to understand query intents on official sites operated by administrative units, and further guide the search engine to recall relevant official sites. We designed a generative retrieval method, called Semantic-enhanced DSI (Semantic-Enhanced Differentiable Search Index Inspired by Learning Strategies), and applied it into this task, which significantly outperformed the existing baseline of Baidu search engine by 8.83% in terms of Recall@20 on the online dataset.
