<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am now a third year Ph.D. student supervised by Prof.[Jiafeng Guo](http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/gjf/), in Computer Science at Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My general research interests lie in the field of information retrieval and natural language processing. Now, My mainly focuses on generative information retrieval.

# 📝 Industry applications
[2024-Present] **Retrieval-augmented Language Model and QA at Baidu search**

[2023] **Official site retrieval at Baidu search**  
Official site retrieval task aims to understand query intents on official sites operated by administrative units, and further guide the search engine to recall relevant official sites. We designed a generative retrieval method, called Semantic-enhanced DSI (Semantic-Enhanced Differentiable Search Index Inspired by Learning Strategies), and applied it into this task, which significantly outperformed the existing baseline of Baidu search engine by 8.83% in terms of Recall@20 on the online dataset.


# 📝 Projects
[2023] **GoGPT: Retrieval-augmented Language Model**  
GoGPT is a comprehensive knowledge-based QA application based on large LLMs. It primarily includes a query understanding module, a retrieval module, an LLM module for retrieval enhancement, a reference tracing module, and an answer generation module. I am one of the core developers, responsible for the development of the query understanding and retrieval modules.
